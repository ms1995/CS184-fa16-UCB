Working on CS184 has always been entertaining. I'm always surprised to see so many wonderful features are achieved using simple empirical approaches, and now I'm able to make them from scratch!

For the first assignment, I made a simple Flappy Bird game using 2D polygons.

For the second assignment, I made a simple renderer that supports only local shading models, spheres and shadows.

For the third assignment, I made a more sophisticated scene renderer, with support for raytracing (that includes shadows and reflection), spheres, triangle meshs, transformations, textures, custom materials and acceleration.

For the fourth assignment, I made a 3D object viewer, with support for Bezier patches, OBJ files and real-time rendering.

Things are getting more exciting and you can see the progress..
